				<h2 class="editable">A Note from Robin and Mark</h2>

				<p class="editable">
					On October 23, 2015, our lives changed forever. Our only child David passed away from a rare and often fatal condition called HLH (Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis). David was 23 years old, had just graduated from American University in May and started his career in Real Estate. On August 3rd 2015, David woke up not feeling well and stayed home from work. Later that same day, Robin took David to Urgent Care as he had a fever of 103.5 with a bad cough. We were told that David had a small spot on his lung which indicated “walking pneumonia” and was sent home with antibiotics and told to rest.
				</p>

				<p class="editable">
					Within 12 hours after returning from Urgent Care, David was rushed to Overlook Hospital as he was having trouble breathing. We were told that he had double pneumonia, developed ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), and his body began to shut down. We were told that the Hospital was going to transfer him to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. David was put into a medically induced coma and quickly transferred to the hospital in NYC, where they could better meet his medical needs.
				</p>

				<p class="editable">
					After 2 ½ weeks of various tests, David’s health continued to decline, and required life support. Finally, they did a bone marrow biopsy and confirmed that he was suffering from HLH. Treatment began immediately and we hoped and prayed for a positive response. David began to respond to the treatments after 6 weeks and make enough progress to be taking off all of the machines that were keeping him alive, and was brought out of his coma.
				</p>

				<p class="editable">
					After spending 9 weeks in the hospital, David was finally able to come home and continue the treatment of HLH, which included chemotherapy. Although we knew that we had a long road ahead of us, we were
optimistic about David’s recovery. David was home for 16 days while still going back to the Columbia Presbyterian Hospital for chemotherapy. Unfortunately, he had a bad reaction to his last chemotherapy treatment and was readmitted to the Hospital. With great shock and sadness, David passed away in less than 24 hours from the complications brought on by his fragile immune system. David was a wonderful son who was kind, loving, sweet, cared about others and had an entire life ahead of him to enjoy. He was taken away from all those that loved him way too soon. We miss David every second of every day.  In his honor and memory, we are dedicated to raising awareness and funds to find a cure for this rare disease.
				</p>

					In memory of David, please consider making a donation to help us fund research, and to educate the medical community to learn more about HLH.

					With much love and appreciation,<br />

			<h2 class="editable">What is Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)?</h2>

			<p class="editable">
				HLH is a rare, life threatening immune system disease. It affects people of all ages and ethnic groups. It is caused by an overactive, inflammatory response and tissue destruction due to abnormal immune system reaction. The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, organs and proteins that work together to keep the body healthy. In HLH the immune systems responds to a stimulus or “trigger," often an infection, but the response is ineffective or abnormal.
			</p>
			<p class="editable">
			This abnormal response, causes a variety of symptoms, which if not treated, can be life threatening. HLH is dangerously aggressive in its progression and attack on vital organs.Common symptoms are fevers, enlarged spleen, low blood counts, liver abnormalities, neurologic problems, respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) often resulting in multi organ failure.
			</p>
			<p class="editable">
				There are two major types of HLH. One type is called “familial” (or primary) HLH. It is an inherited condition, which means it can be passed down from generation to generation. A second type is called “Acquired” (or secondary) HLH. Doctors currently do not think acquired HLH is inherited. Instead, it is thought to result from  a reaction to a specific infections, cancers and autoimmune disorders. Sometimes they cannot detect any trigger.  This type usually occurs in older children and adults.
			</p>
			<p class="editable">
				HLH is very difficult to diagnosis. Firstly, most doctors and medical staff have never heard of it or seen an actual  case. Secondly, it presents with symptoms that are common to many different disorders and conditions, which ultimately adds to the difficulty. The only definite way to diagnosis it is by doing  extensive blood work, genetic testing and analyzing a bone marrow biopsy. Left untreated, the prognosis of HLH is poor and generally fatal. Mortality in secondary HLH has been reported to vary from 8–22% in rheumatological HLH to 18–24% in EBV HLH.
			</p>
			<p class="editable">
				The key to improving outcomes for HLH patients is swift diagnosis and research. If we teach more emergency department doctors, family practitioners and pediatricians about how HLH presents in it's early stages, we can save more lives. Most of the time HLH is diagnosed after all other options have been exhausted or it is misdiagnosed, thus losing valuable treatment time. It can take several weeks, months or never be diagnosed.  Doctors do not completely understand why certain people develop acquired HLH.
