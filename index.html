			<h2 class="editable">What is Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)?</h2>

			<p class="editable">
				HLH is a rare, life threatening immune system disease. It affects people of all ages and ethnic groups. It is caused by an overactive, inflammatory response and tissue destruction due to abnormal immune system reaction. The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, organs and proteins that work together to keep the body healthy. In HLH the immune systems responds to a stimulus or “trigger," often an infection, but the response is ineffective or abnormal.
			</p>
			<p class="editable">
			This abnormal response, causes a variety of symptoms, which if not treated, can be life threatening. HLH is dangerously aggressive in its progression and attack on vital organs.Common symptoms are fevers, enlarged spleen, low blood counts, liver abnormalities, neurologic problems, respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) often resulting in multi organ failure.
			</p>
			<p class="editable">
				There are two major types of HLH. One type is called “familial” (or primary) HLH. It is an inherited condition, which means it can be passed down from generation to generation. A second type is called “Acquired” (or secondary) HLH. Doctors currently do not think acquired HLH is inherited. Instead, it is thought to result from  a reaction to a specific infections, cancers and autoimmune disorders. Sometimes they cannot detect any trigger.  This type usually occurs in older children and adults.
			</p>
			<p class="editable">
				HLH is very difficult to diagnosis. Firstly, most doctors and medical staff have never heard of it or seen an actual  case. Secondly, it presents with symptoms that are common to many different disorders and conditions, which ultimately adds to the difficulty. The only definite way to diagnosis it is by doing  extensive blood work, genetic testing and analyzing a bone marrow biopsy. Left untreated, the prognosis of HLH is poor and generally fatal. Mortality in secondary HLH has been reported to vary from 8–22% in rheumatological HLH to 18–24% in EBV HLH.
			</p>
			<p class="editable">
				The key to improving outcomes for HLH patients is swift diagnosis and research. If we teach more emergency department doctors, family practitioners and pediatricians about how HLH presents in it's early stages, we can save more lives. Most of the time HLH is diagnosed after all other options have been exhausted or it is misdiagnosed, thus losing valuable treatment time. It can take several weeks, months or never be diagnosed.  Doctors do not completely understand why certain people develop acquired HLH.
