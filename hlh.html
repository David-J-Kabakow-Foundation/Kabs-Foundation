            <h3>What is Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)?</h3>
            <p class="editable">
                HLH is a rare, life threatening immune system disease affecting people of all ages and ethnic groups. It is caused by an overactive, inflammatory response and tissue destruction due to abnormal immune system reaction. 
            </p>
            <p class="editable">
                The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, organs and proteins that work together to keep the body healthy. In HLH, the immune system responds to a stimulus or â€œtrigger," often an infection, but the response is ineffective or abnormal. This abnormal response causes a variety of symptoms which, if not treated, can be life threatening. HLH is dangerously aggressive in its progression and attack on vital organs.

            <h3>The Two Major Types of HLH</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Familial (Primary HLH)</b> - This type is inherited, meaning it can be passed down from generation to generation.</li>
                <li><b>Acquired (Secondary HLH)</b> - Doctors currently do not believe this type is inherited. Instead, it is thought to result from a reaction to specific infections, cancers and autoimmune disorders. Sometimes they cannot detect any trigger. This type usually occurs in older children and adults. Doctors do not completely understand why certain people develop acquired HLH.
