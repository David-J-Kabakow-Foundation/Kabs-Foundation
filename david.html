            <p class="editable">David was 23 years old when he died. When we think back about his life, we realized he packed in a lot of interests and accomplishments into those 23 years.</p>
            <p class="editable">When David was small, it was evident that he had a big personality. He was interested in acting and singing (choir) and participated in numerous school and camp shows. He became an aid at our temple’s religious school for a child with special needs, and now an award is given to one aid every year in his honor. In David’s senior year of high school, he was awarded The Westfield High School Business Award.</p>
            <p class="editable">Anyone who knew David knew he was obsessed with real estate from a young age. David worked after school at Remax and Coldwell Banker. The minute he turned 18 years old, he became a licensed real estate agent in New Jersey and New York. During summer break, David sold his first house. We never saw him so happy. After he graduated from American University, with a degree in Real Estate, he was offered an internship at Core Real Estate. He even appeared on an episode of “Selling New York,” which featured the firm.</p>
            <p class="editable">At American, David was active in the Gospel Choir and became president senior year. They had a beautiful concert in his honor in December 2015.  He was also a founding member of AU’s Zeta Beta Tau chapter.</p>
            <p class="editable">David went to Camp Echo Lake for five years as a camper and one year as a counselor.</p>
