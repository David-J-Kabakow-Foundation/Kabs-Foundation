                    <h2 class="editable">A Message From Robin and Mark Kabakow</h2>
                    <p class="editable">October 23rd, 2021 is the 6th anniversary of our son David losing his battle with Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). We have created the David J Kabakow Foundation in hope of raising funds to help educate the medical community about this rare disease, and secondly to help fund research of adult HLH.</p>
                    <p class="editable">Since the foundation's launch in March of this year, we have been able to connect with Dr. Nancy Berliner at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. We first met her at an HLH Conference at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, which is the leading authority on diagnosing and treating Childhood HLH. At the conference we heard Dr. Berliner’s presentation and her focus is on Adult HLH. Dr. Berliner has agreed to partner with us to help us carry out our mission of education and research of Secondary Adult HLH. Prior to COVID-19, in addition to her other responsibilities, Dr. Berliner flew around the country making presentations to medical professionals (Grand Rounds). We have chosen to work with Dr. Berliner because she is one of the leading doctors in the field of Hematology and one who specifically has interest in researching Adult HLH. </p>
