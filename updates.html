                    <h3>David's 30th Birthday</h3>
                    <p>When we start to see green shamrocks and leprechauns, we know that it is almost David’s birthday. Today, March 17th, 2022 would have been David’s 30th Birthday.</p>
                    <p>As many of you know, David had acquired Adult (Secondary) HLH, which is a very rare disease. After David passed away, we made a pact to always tell any new doctor we meet about HLH. Many physicians, nurse pracitioners, and caregivers are unfamiliar with the disease. These knowledge gaps have led to under-diagnosis and delayed diagnosis with poor outcomes, and many Adult HLH patients die undiagnosed. This fact is what motivated us to start this foundation. There is a great need to educate the medical community about this orphan disease so more patients can get the treatment they need.</p>
                    <p>We are pleased to announce that we are in continued discussions with Dr. Nancy Berliner, Chief of Hematology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA to establish The David J. Kabakow Lectureship. Guest lecturers from around the world will be invited to Brigham to talk about HLH. It will also be taped by the Brigham Audio Visual Team and made available to other experts and professional associations, and to the David J. Kabakow Foundation to share with supporters via the Foundation’s website and other digital communications.</p>
                    <p>Our mission is more awareness and quicker diagnosis of Adult HLH. This annual Lectureship will require us to raise additional funds to meet the necessary requirements of the Lectureship.</p>
                    <p>Please help us educate the medical community.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>
                    <p>Robin & Mark Kabakow</p>

                    <h3 class="editable">A Message From Robin and Mark Kabakow</h3>
                    <p class="editable">October 23rd, 2021 is the 6th anniversary of our son David losing his battle with Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). We have created the David J Kabakow Foundation in hope of raising funds to help educate the medical community about this rare disease, and secondly to help fund research of adult HLH.</p>
                    <p class="editable">Since the foundation's launch in March of this year, we have been able to connect with Dr. Nancy Berliner at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. We first met her at an HLH Conference at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, which is the leading authority on diagnosing and treating Childhood HLH. At the conference we heard Dr. Berliner’s presentation and her focus is on Adult HLH. Dr. Berliner has agreed to partner with us to help us carry out our mission of education and research of Secondary Adult HLH. Prior to COVID-19, in addition to her other responsibilities, Dr. Berliner flew around the country making presentations to medical professionals (Grand Rounds). We have chosen to work with Dr. Berliner because she is one of the leading doctors in the field of Hematology and one who specifically has interest in researching Adult HLH. </p>
